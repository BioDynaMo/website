In the early days of BioDynaMo, the project started with the goal to modernize the Cortex3D code and to accelerate its computations. 
While BioDyanMo has turned into a general purpose agent-based modling software since then, we want to give an overview over impactful publications based on Cortex3D because these were the driving force in the early stages of the project.
